# Atomic-Ledger-Py Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-01

## Core Principles

### I. Immutability
The ledger is append-only. No entries may be modified or deleted. Corrections use compensating transactions.

### II. Double-Entry Integrity
Every transaction MUST balance. The sum of debits MUST equal the sum of credits.

### III. Atomic Commits
Transactions are all-or-nothing. Partial commits are not permitted.

### IV. Audit Trail
All operations are logged with timestamps and actor identification.
